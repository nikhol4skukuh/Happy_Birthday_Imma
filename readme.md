# 2017 Birthday Site for Gina

My kids and I created a little website for my wife for her birthday. The site is "<a href="http://happy-bday.gnatj.com/" target="_blank">Happy birthday אמא</a>" and it's written in HTML and CSS.

I created it before I had much knowledge of JavaScript, and was largely an opportunity to practice my knowledge of CSS at the time.
